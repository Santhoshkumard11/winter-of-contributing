# Introduce JavaScript's usage in the Command-Line 
<br>

***JavaScript*** is a powerful, widely used, open-source, and dynamic programming language used to add and render interactivity on websites. Also, a variety of other developer tools have been built on top of it, giving rise to a vast range of functionalities that can be implemented with ease to add on the dynamism of the website.<br>

Besides using JS to render user-friendly interactive functionalities and features on our websites, a JavaScript shell (Command-line) enables us to quickly run and test snippets of JS code without having to load and reload it in a web page. This makes developing and debugging JS code extremely easy. These JS program that run on Command Line Interfaces (CLI) are the standalone JS scripts.
<hr>
Some JavaScript shells that are stand-alone environments are:

- ***NodeJS*** - Node.js is a platform for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
- ***GraalJS*** - A high performance implementation of the JavaScript programming language. Built on the GraalVM by Oracle Labs.
- ***ShellJS*** - Portable Unix shell commands for Node.js

***Node.js*** is a popular JS runtime environment for creating web applications on server side, that is it allows us to run JS on the backend outside the browser. It comes with a lot of built-in modules and it enables us to run and test JS code very fast and efficiently mainly because of its asynchronous event run model running on Google V8 engine.
<br>

Run our first JS program as follows : <br>
Having Node.js installed in our system, to run a stand-alone JS program in node.js, we follow steps as :<br>
- Open any text editor and create a JS file with any piece of JS sample code. Like, here, I used VS code to create the js file with the code shown.

- Open terminal or command prompt
- Change the directory and file path to where the JS file is located
- Run the code `node <name of the file>`

- Verify the output.

Now, coming to ***NPM***, a popular package manager for JavaScript, can be used to install almost any node modules, we need to work on the front-end of our applications. Similarly, ***NodeJs***, besides backend, can efficiently be used for the front-end of our application. 
  
We can also install and use Bootstrap, skeleton and other front-end frameworks via npm.

Some popular NodeJs frameworks for web-applications are ***Express.JS, Feather.js, Meteor.js, Total.js, Socket.io, Nest.js, Hapi.js, Sails.js etc***.

Developing desktop applications can be full of challenges that make it difficult to approach, considering the hard parts for things like packaging, installation and managing updates but there's also the design of the application itself where we have to translate creativity across different operating systems. If we want to make use of native features like menus and notifications, that presents hurdles even for experienced developers, supporting multiple platforms.<br><br>
What if we can combine the pervasiveness of web technology and the native experience of a desktop application, across the cross-platform versatility of the different web browser and wrap everything everything into a single package with all the advantages!<br><br>
  
***ElectronJS*** is a Framework that lets us create cross-platform applications using HTML, JavaScript and css. It does this by providing rich the JavaScript API that can handle the particulars of talking to different operating systems and also uses web pages for creating the user interfaces. <br>
We can think of an Electron app is a kind of a minimal web browser with the ability to interact with the local file system and this web browser is part of the application packaging, so we can code with confidence knowing everyone using your app is running it under the same set of conditions but most importantly, this means we can write your application once and have it run on Mac, Windows, or Linux because Electron serves as a universal Interface of the operating system. <br>
 
Overall, it serves for :
- Simplified management with high performance
- Cross-platform compatibility and thus, a reusable framework
- Interaction with web UI/UX tools
- High data security

Coming to Native and Hybrid frameworks, ***Hybrid*** are built upon web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript whereas ***Native*** frameworks are built with specific technology and language for specific platforms like Java for Android, Swift for iOS. So, hybrid framework supports a single code base for all platforms, i.e write once and run anywhere but for native app scenarios, we need to build and maintain separate apps and code for different platforms.<br>

***ðŸ“ŒReact Native*** is a hybrid mobile application development framework,  for developing hybrid mobile applications that can run natively on both Android and iOS. So, React Native, written on JavaScript, is classified as a hybrid framework as it is platform independent. It tends to combine the high-performance capabilities of a native application while retaining the fundamental ease of development as in web technologies.<br><br>
***ðŸ“ŒIonic*** is a hybrid app development framework  for web developers. We can build amazing mobile, web, and desktop apps all with one shared code base and open web standards. It uses **Cordova**, an open-source mobile development framework. behind the scenes.<br><br>
However, considering the pros and cons, the choice between Native or Hybrid frameworks is based on different use cases, ideas and goals.
