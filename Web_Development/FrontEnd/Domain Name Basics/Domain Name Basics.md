## ***üìåWhat is a domain name / domain?***

A ***domain name*** or simply known as ***domain*** is a online address that typically takes the form of your organization's name and a standard internet suffix, for example, ***mybusiness.com or stateuniversity.edu, google.com, wikipedia.org.*** etc. These domain names are unique for a particular organisation and are associated with a physical IP address on the Internet, which in turn, is associated with a unique system connected to the internet.  For instance, the domain name `example.com` might translate to the physical address `198.102.434.8`.

<br>

It basically follows after the `@` sign in email addresses, and after `www.` in web addresses. <br>
For example, your domain is ***your-organisation.com***, and you have a website ***www.your-organisation.com*** and email at ***example@your-organisation.com.***
We can either use a domain name that you already own or we can purchase a domain suiting our needs from ***domain registrar***, which is a company that sells domain names that aren't yet owned and are therefore available for registration. Some damain name registrars are ***GoDaddy, 1&1, domain.com*** etc.

## ***üìåIP Address***
An ***Internet Protocol(IP) address*** is a set of numerical instructions in the form of numbers that identifies the physical location of a particular device on the web. An IP address is a string of numbers separated by periods, expressed as a set of four numbers, each number in the set can range from `0 to 255`.
<br>
An IP address looks something like this: `74.125.19.147`. IP addresses are made up of binary values that drive the routing of all data over the Internet. There are two versions of IP that currently coexist in the global Internet: `IP version 4 (IPv4)` and `IP version 6 (IPv6)`. IP addresses are made up of binary values and drive the routing of all data over the Internet. IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, and IPv6 addresses 128 bits long.

## ***üìåWhy a domain name?***
<br>
Using a domain name to identify a location on the Internet rather than the numeric IP address makes it much easier to remember and type web addresses.

It is an easy-to-remember name than numerical IP addresses, which are long sequences of numbers.

<hr>


## ***üìåDomain name Vs IP Address***

An ***IP address*** communicates exact information about the address in a way that is useful to the computer but makes no sense to humans, whereas, the ***domain name*** functions as a link to the IP address. Links do not contain actual information, but they do point to the place where the IP address information resides. <br>
It is convenient to think of IP addresses as the *actual locator* that identifies a definite point on the internet and the domain name as a *label* that identifies the locator.

<hr>


## ***üìåWhat does the domain name conveys?***
Domain names function on the Internet in a manner that each part of the domain name provides specific pieces of information, by which the web browsers locate the web page across the internet. The naming system is closely regulated in order to prevent confusion or duplicate addresses. A new Internet Protocol version, or *IPv6*, was created partly to address exponentially increasing demands for domain names.

<hr>


## ***üìåWorking of domain names:***
Domain names provide the users with a memorable short name. While users enter web addresses into the URL field or address bar at the top of their browser‚Äôs page from left to right, the domain name itself is read from right to left according to the naming hierarchy as follows. This link provides instructions to the network, which ultimately results in a successful response at the client end, completing the transaction.


## ***üìåParts of domain name:***
Generally a domain name `example.com`, has two essential parts, separated by a period.
<br>

- .com ‚Äì This is the top-level domain.
- .example. ‚Äì This is a subdomain.

Sometimes a part preceding the sub-domain is the subdomain prefix, like *www* in *www.example.com*

<br>
Many servers use a three-letter naming convention for top-level domains. The significance of the *top-level domain* is the most important as it identifies the highest part of the naming system used on the Internet. This naming system was originally created to identify countries and organizations as well as categories.
The most common categories are easily recognized by new computer users, and they include:

- .com
- .org
- .edu
- .net
- .mil
- .biz
- .museum
- .info
- .name

<br>

Country codes like *.in, .uk,* etc are also abbreviated as top-level domain used for other purposes.
<br>

*Subdomains* are the part of the domain system that is most recognizable to humans. There are also several levels of subdomains, and some countries developed specific conventions of the organization to communicate information within their internal naming systems.The organization of the domain name hierarchy and the ability to reserve them for only one purpose has already undergone several modifications. Discussions and debates concerning the availability and affordability of domain names can be expected to continue.
 
### ***Subdomain***
A *subdomain* can also be a domain that forms part of a larger domain. For example, mail.google.com, www.google.com, and docs.google.com are all subdomains of the domain google.com. Domain owners can create subdomains to provide easy-to-remember addresses for web pages or services within their top-level domain.


### ***Domain alias***
A *domain alias* is a domain name that acts as an alias for another domain. A domain to our account can be as a domain alias to give everyone in our domain, another email address at the domain alias. Mail sent to either of a user's addresses arrives at the user's same email inbox.

<hr>
 
## ***üìåDNS***
*The Domain Name System (DNS)*, was designed to provide a distributed directory of alphabetical names that correspond to these numbers.
<br>
This system is essentially like the ‚Äúphone book‚Äù of the Web that organizes and identifies domains. While a phone book translates a name like "Peter Parker" into the correct phone number to call, the DNS maps and translates a web address like "www.google.com" into the physical IP address‚Äîsuch as "74.125.19.147" that is of the computer hosting that site .

### ***Some terminologies:***
- *Domain host:* 
A domain host is a company that runs the DNS servers for your domain and manages its DNS records.
 
- *Name server:* 
A name server serves as a reference point for your domain‚Äôs DNS data and is typically maintained by a domain host company. 
 
- *WHOIS directory:*
The WHOIS directory is a public listing of domain names, and the people or organizations associated with each name.
Some domain name owners might prefer to have their personal information hidden from the WHOIS directory, just as we might want your personal telephone number to be unlisted from a local telephone book.

<br>
 
We are periodically able to modify our DNS settings to set up various tools and services. We do this by changing various types of ***DNS records***, meant for handling authorative instructions of our DNS servers, namely, *MX Record, TXT Record, NS Record* etc.

<hr>


 
We often confuse ***domain names*** with universal ***resource locators or URLs and Internet Protocol or IP addresses.*** <br>
 
## ***üìåUniform Resource Locator (URL)***
A URL is the web address of a resource on the Internet. This is the address you type in a browser to visit a particular web site. <br><br>
 
The domain name is one of the pieces inside a URL and most easily recognized part of the entire address. When computer users type a web address directly into the address box at the top of their browser window, it initiates a process of locating the page requested. To do so, the instructions contained inside the URL, including the domain name, must correctly point to that location. The IP address is a numerical code that makes this possible.
 
To summarize, the domain name is a part of the URL, which points to the associated IP address. <br><br>

***A popular analogy can be : ‚ÄúPeople find web pages in a manner similar to the way that they use maps to find physical locations. If the Internet is like a phone book, and a web page is like a physical building, the URL would be the precise street address of that building. The IP address would be like the car that travels to its destination.‚Äù***
